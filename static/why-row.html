						ROTA creates innovative wheelchairs that users “row” driving you to better health and wellbeing.
						</h1>
					
					<h1 style="padding-top: 20px;">Efficiency</h1>
						<p>
							ROTA’s integrated, lightweight and biomechanically efficient powertrain, delivers outstanding multiple speed and torque performance on push and pull.
						</p>
						<p>
							The ROTA powertrain gives riders the option of 8 gearing ratios that can be shifted at a low velocity or input force. But we didn’t stop there. Depending on how much input force you need, you can extend the telescopic lever arm. Hills - no problem.
						</p>
						<p>
							The push-pull lever is three times the length of a bicycle crank. That’s three times the mechanical advantage.
						</p>
						<p>
							The sophisticated powertrain transmission can free wheel and includes a clutch that prevents the rider from rolling back. Stop on an incline and just relax. There’s no need to keep a hold on your pushrims.
						</p>
						<p>
							Because pushrim propulsion is ideal for maneuvering in confined spaces the powertrain can be disengaged. That’s the kind of smart, integrated design that sets the RoChair and RoTrike apart from other wheelchairs.
						</p>
					
					<h1 style="padding-top: 10px;">Ergonomics</h1>
						<p>
							Lever-propelled wheelchairs have been described as more efficient and less physically demanding than traditional pushrim wheelchairs. Propelling with a lever mechanism provides a more effective transfer of power by placing the arms in a more natural segmental position and orientation.						
						</p>
						<p>
							ROTA’s front-and-center lever propulsion is a really healthy solution. Front-and-center propulsion eliminates the injurious non-sagittal plane propulsion geometry and peak strain forces incurred when using individual levers and pushrims. With your propulsion mechanism aligned with your torso core muscle groups are employed and developed in symmetry.
						</p>

					<h1 style="padding-top: 10px;">Transfers</h1>
						<p>
							Lifting your body in and out of your chair induces peak strain forces on your shoulders and wrists. ROTA rides use 20 inch wheels located under the seat making transfers a breeze. In park-mode just swing up one of the arm rests and slide right on in uninhibited by wheels or side guards. You’ll find lots of clearance to swing your leg over the powertrain.
						</p>
					
					<h1 style="padding-top: 10px;">Steering</h1>
						<p>
							ROTA rides steer just like a bicycle. It couldn’t be any simpler. With the RoChair and RoTrike you have incredible maneuverability.
						</p>
						<p>
							RoChair turns in its own footprint just like your everyday chair.
						</p>
						<p>
							RoTrike has an in-drive turning radius of just 36 inches. Turn the handlebar and the front wheel turns.
						</p>
						
					<h1 style="padding-top: 10px;">Braking</h1>
						<p>
							Just pull all the way back on the lever like you would the reigns of a horse and the vehicle engages powerful disc brakes.
						</p>
						<p>
							A simple latch can be used to secure the brakes in park-mode for transfers, riding in vehicles or when at a table.
						</p>
						<p>
							Standard braking functions have been designed to be universally accessible for paraplegic and tetra/quadriplegic riders with limited hand/grip function.
						</p>
							
					<h1 style="padding-top: 10px;">Size and Weight</h1>
						<p>
							A lot of manufacturers have made crude attempts to add levers onto wheelchairs. ROTA is the only company to have achieved an integrated solution offering front-and-center mounted push-pull lever propulsion.
						</p>
						<p>
							Front-and-center is a big deal. The mechanism adds zero width to the vehicle. In fact, ROTA vehicles are on average four to six inches narrower than many popular ultralight wheelchairs. Most add-on lever or reduced gearing propulsion options on the market today are cumbersome and heavy.
						</p>

					<h1 style="padding-top: 10px;">Fit</h1>
						<p>
							Traditional pushrim wheelchairs come in all shapes and sizes. Pushrim wheelchair users who have issues with immobility or decreased sensation frequently cannot maintain proper positioning or are unaware that they have swayed from an upright, symmetrical posture. Asymmetrical posture during propulsion can lead not only to upper body ambulation, but also to problems with function, skin integrity, breathing, swallowing and digestion.
						</p>
						<p>
							ROTA’s integrated front-and-center propulsion facilitates and develops good riding posture. The requirement for fitting necessary to ensure a user’s optimum position for pushrim propulsion is eliminated. Front-and-center propulsion also prevents a rider from tipping from side-to-side (falling out of his/her ride). ROTA products are made for both para and quad riders.
						</p>
						<p>
							ROTA riders can easily adjust their seat back and base angles themselves. Full adjustability has also been designed into the foot stirrups. The requirement for fitting necessary to match the seat width to a rider is eliminated having placed the rear wheels underneath the seat. This design also allows for unobstructed transfer. Your center of gravity is optimally placed over the wheels.
						</p>						

					<h1 style="padding-top: 10px;">ROTA ride innovation</h1>
						<p>
							Ergonomics and performance. Powertrain and ride. Design and distribution. Manufacturing and engineering. They’re all part of a single process at ROTA. From the smallest detail to the biggest engineering breakthrough, ROTA rides are the next generation of mobility devices.
						</p>

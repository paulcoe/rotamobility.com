				The www.rotamobility.com website (the “Website”) is provided as an online resource from ROTA Mobility Inc. (“ROTA Mobility”) from which to obtain information about, pre-order, and order ROTA Mobility’ products. This Website is operated by ROTA Mobility. More details about ROTA Mobility can be found on the Website under “About Us”.
			</p>	
			<p>
				We understand that providing information online involves a great deal of trust on your part. We take this trust very seriously, and make it a high priority to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personal information you provide to us. Before submitting your personal information to our Website, please read this Policy carefully to learn about our privacy practices. By visiting the Website, you are accepting the practices described herein.
			</p>
			<h4>
				What Information We Collect from You
			</h4>
			<h4>
				In General.
			</h4>
			<p>
				We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or give us in any other way. This may include information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and e-mail addresses, user name, and password. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to enjoy parts of this Website. For example, some information is required in order for you to ask us a question or initiate other transactions on our Website.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Information about Others.
			</h4>
			<p>
				You may have the opportunity to provide contact information for other people through our Website. You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing ROTA Mobility with their personal information.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Information from Other Sources.
			</h4>
			<p>
				We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners, and other independent third-party sources and add it to other information about you. For example, if you visit ROTA Mobility’ websites by “clicking-through” from a site operated by one of our business partners, and you have registered with that partner, then information about you that you have provided to that partner may be shared with us, such as contact information and demographic information. As another example, if you access third-party services, such as social media services, through our Website or before coming to our Website, we may collect information such as your user name, password, and other information made available to us through those services in order to improve and personalize your use of our Website.
			</p>	
			<h4>
				Automatic Information.
			</h4>
			<p>	
				We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit the ROTA Mobility Website. For example, we will collect session data, including your IP address, Web browser software, and referring website. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as content viewed and pages visited. One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help us understand the interests of our users and customize your user experience.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Cookies and Other Web Technologies.
			</h4>	
			<p>
				Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer’s hard drive (if your Web browser permits). ROTA Mobility and its affiliated websites use cookies for the following general purposes:
			</p>
			<ul>	
			<li>
				To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting our site. For example, if you register on our site, we may use cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not need to log into our site each time you visit. We also may record your password in a cookie, if you checked the box entitled "Save this password for automatic sign-in." Please note that user IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes.
			</li>
			<li>
				To help us customize the content and website experience provided to you on our websites and on other websites across the Internet. For example, when you access a web page, a cookie is automatically set by us, our service providers, or our partners to recognize your browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present you with information based on your apparent interests.
			</li>
			<li>
				To help measure and research the effectiveness of website features and offerings, advertisements, and e-mail communications (by determining which e-mails you open and act upon).
			</li>	

			<li>
			The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers should tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable most types of cookies. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to access some of the tools offered on our sites.
			</li>
			</ul>
